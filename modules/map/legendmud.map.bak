A giant 'slurp' precedes your descent into the muck, the water growing ever closer to your neck. You try and gasp for air, reach out to grasp the nearest branch, but it is too late. You manage to gulp down one last bit of air before sliding through the ooze, the water covering your eyes, your head, your hair... Through the decay and death that makes up the floor of the swamp, you slide through, the rocks embedded in the muck scraping against your skin. You close your eyes and think that it might all be over, that last breath running out...  You blink your eyes a few times, getting the last bits of mud out from the corners. Suddenly realizing that it's safe to breathe again, you notice you are surrounded by some pocket of air. Magical or not, you thank the gods for your next breath and begin to wonder how you might escape.} {Celtic Ireland } {} {} {} {1.000}
